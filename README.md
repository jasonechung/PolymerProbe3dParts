# PolymerProbe3dParts
3d printed parts used in insertion and implantation of polymer electrode arrays related to: High-density, long-lasting, and multi-region electrophysiological recordings using polymer electrode arrays, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.11.002

#Insertion parts
- StiffenerInserter.stl: Stiffener is directly tetherd to this piece, also a one-axis inserter
- InsertionDock.stl: One-axis inserter directly attached, also screwed into ProbeConInserter
- ProbeConInserter: Connector end of polymer probe is attached to this piece. It is temporarily affixed to the StiffenerInserter while the polymer probe is being prepared for sterilization and is affixed to the InsertionDock for insertion.
- Alignment.stl: Placed onto the StiffenerInserter while the polymer probe stiffener is being aligned and glued to the StiffenerInserter. Removed before sterilization

#Post-insertion implant and probe housing parts
- BaseExample1.stl: Base piece to be affixed to skull designed for targeting of left hippocampus and bilateral medial prefrontal cortex in rat
- BaseExample2.stl: Base piece to be affixed to skull designed for targeting of bilateral hippocampus and bilateral OFC in rat
- BaseExample3.stl: Base piece to be affixed to skull designed for targeting of bilateral medial prefrontal cortex in rat
- HousingLeft_1.stl: Example piece designed to enclose the left half of BaseExample2 (bilateral hippocampus, bilateral OFC). Designed to fit loosely, house polymer probe ribbons with silicone fill. Requires acrylic or other adhesive to be affixed to base piece and skull. 
- HousingRight_1.stl: Example piece designed to enclose the right half of BaseExample2 (bilateral hippocampus, bilateral OFC). Designed to fit loosely, house polymer probe ribbons with silicone fill. Requires acrylic or other adhesive to be affixed to base piece and skull. 
- HousingLeft_2.stl: Example piece for implant construction, designed to attach to HousingLeft_1 and HousingRight_2, covered with HousingCap
- HousingRight_2.stl: Example piece for implant construction, designed to attach to HousingRight_1 and HousingLeft_2, covered with HousingCap
- HousingCap.stl: Example implant cap, designed to slide over the assembled HousingLeft_2 and HousingRight_2
